# Terraform Cloud Resources Creation

Welcome to my Terraform repository! This repository provides Terraform configurations and examples to teach you how to create cloud resources in AWS and Azure using Terraform.

## Introduction

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. It allows you to define and provision your infrastructure using a high-level configuration language.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into directories for AWS and Azure, each containing Terraform configurations to create various cloud resources. You'll find examples and step-by-step guides to help you get started.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed.
- Configure your cloud provider credentials (AWS and/or Azure).

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Wolfgang-Amadeus-Mozart/Terraform.git

2. **Follow the Instructions in Each Directory:**

Each directory contains a README.md file with specific instructions on how to initialize and apply the Terraform configurations for that cloud provider.
